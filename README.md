# archaeo_site_map

This is a script for creating an interactive map for showing archaeological sites.

## Usage

1. The user requires a 'mapbox' account and Plotly account.
   Ensure that the mapbox API key is shared with Plotly.
2. Place the mapbox key into a file call "mapbok_accesstoken.txt"
   Ensure this file is in the same directory that the script is 
   executed from.
3. A csv file in the same format as 'example_file.csv' is required.
   The data will be divided into groups based on the values in the
   'Period' column.
